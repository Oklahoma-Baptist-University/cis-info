                    <h1>What does a computer science degree from OBU look like?</h1>
                    <hr class="separator">
                    <p>One of the major advantages you gain from obtaining a degree in computer science from 
                        Oklahoma Baptist University is that you aren't limited to learning a bunch of different 
                        coding languages. Instead, you are provided with opportunities to dozens of different 
                        skillsets that are all applicable to the wider world of business. With solid foundations 
                        in mathematics, applied physics, and business fundamentals, you will come away with not 
                        only the knowledge and skills necessary to develop compelling software the solves problems, 
                        but also the understanding of how your software impacts an entire organization or community. 
                        Graduates from OBU have gone on to fill in dozens of complex business-oriented rolls that 
                        were complimented by their technical and creative training during their time at OBU. For 
                        more information about the program,
